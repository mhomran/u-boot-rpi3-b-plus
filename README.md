# About


In this repository, I will demonstrate how to boot a 64-bit kernel using u-boot and busybox. I struggled to find a complete guide to make me able to do that. I did some reverse engineering on a working system to understand what I'm supposed to do to boot my custom kernel. So I will try to show that in detail with some screen shots. My purpose is to make things easy for everyone else to build their own kernel without hassle. 

I use a USB drive to boot my custom kernel and not an SD card. A USB drive is much easier for you to remove and plug back in again. Luckily, rpi3b+ can boot from a USB drive without any necessary configuration. All you just need to do is to unplug the SD card if it exists.

First, the ROM bootloader shipped with the vendor starts. Then, the second bootloader `bootcode.bin` starts. After that, `start.elf` starts and makes a Flattened Device Tree (FDT) using the device tree binary .dtb in the boot folder and applies overlays that're written in `config.txt`.


It's important to mention how to apply a device tree overlay when it comes to raspberry pi. `u-boot` uses a library called `libfdt` to deal with device trees and apply overlays to them. Unfortunately, raspberry pi device trees don't follow the standard that this library uses. So, whenever I tryied to apply an overlay, it always fails with `FDT_ERR_NOTFOUND`.


To get over this problem, we can <b>reuse</b> the same `FDT` offered by `start.elf` and make u-boot pypasses it to the kernel. This will allow us to enable whatever overlays we want by writing their names in `config.txt`. The downside of this method is that we always need to provide the device tree in the boot directory. It can't be downloaded from an


# 1- Prepare your USB drive

Your USB drive should have two partitions. One should be in `FAT` format. Usually, it's called `boot`. This filesystem will hold the kernel files, the bootloaders, device trees, and overlays. Another one can be in ext4 format. This one holds the linux file system. It's usually called `rootfs`. The file system size should be large enough to hold the content in it.

You can partition your SD card using either the Ubuntu Disks utility or `fdisk` command. There are plenty of sources out there to show you how to partition your drive.
